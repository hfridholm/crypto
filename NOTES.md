# Notes
- allocate the result memory in skey_encode instead of filling result.
- add quiet/silent argument to the utilities, and output messages
- write good README.md
- fix makefile
- hide structure of skey and pkey
- add errno to rsa.h
- memory check in rsa

  (it seams like keys 1024-bit and over have this problem)

## Maybe
